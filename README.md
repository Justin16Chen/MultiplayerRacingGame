# MultiplayerRacingGame
 it is a multiplayer racing game
it is very cool

current version--where i am at

creating server and client windows to create/connect to game is working
- prob want to refactor client code to have parent `Client` class controlling `ConnectFrame` and `PlayerFrame`
- also want to improve UI

`PlayerFrame` is currently broken - nothing happens when you actually connect and start the game
